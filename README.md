### Here we can see most of the columns are not correlated each other. Only one column are correlated.

## We'll see Bivariate Analysis

## Here we can see the dataset is imbalanced. We have balance the data. so we're going to use Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Techniques (SMOTE).

## Model Building

## Creating a model Pipline

## Here we can see the performance comparision. As per our model implement we can say the random forest is the best model to our problem statement.

## Here, we have build the Random Forest Classifier model with default parameter of n_estimators = 10

## After analysing the feature importance, the above showing visualization is the best suit for our model to get more score and working well.

## In our problem statement, they mentioned to use logistic regression. Logistic also a good model to implement the classification problem.
